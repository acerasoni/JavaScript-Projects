## Raycasting

This exercise was built with the p5.js library and inspired from The Coding Train's video on raycasting (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo). The objective of this project was to simulate a 2D environment in which a point casts rays onto randomly generated borders around it, known as raycasting or line of sight 2D.
 
## Snake
