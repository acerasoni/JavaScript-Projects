# About
Developed and Maintained by [Andrea Giulio Cerasoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreacerasoni/)

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript programs ranging from simple exercises to more complex projects with the aim of practicing the JavaScript language and surrounding frameworks, and to gain exposure to physics and game engines.

# Setup Instructions

Running the code is super easy. Simply click on the title for any of the projects below.

## [Raycasting](/raycasting/index.html)


This exercise was built with the p5.js library and inspired from [The Coding Train's video on raycasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo). The objective of this project was to simulate a 2D environment in which a point casts rays onto randomly generated borders around it, known as raycasting or line of sight 2D.
 
## [Tensor Product](/tensor_product/index.html)

This program generates two distinct undirected graphs with a pre-determined number of vertices and edges, coloring them with the minimum possible number of colors such that two adjacent edges are not colored the same. The program then computes the [tensor product of the two graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product_of_graphs) and displays the output. A future iteration of this project will try to find an algorithm that can color the tensor product with a number of colors less than the minimum between the first two graphs. This project was built with the p5.js library.

You can adjust screen, vertices, and edges settings via sketch.js. Please note that the program will not run if the number of edges exceeds the maximum number of edges possible for the number of vertices entered 

Max edges: n * (n - 1) where n = number of vertices

## [Game of Life](/game_of_life/index.html)

This is my implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) made with the p5.js library.

## [Snake](/snake/index.html)

This project emulates the famous snake game, built with the p5.js library.
